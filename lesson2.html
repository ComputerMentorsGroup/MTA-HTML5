Geraldine, the assistant to the company owner, is learning HTML. Her markup as shown below isn’t rendering as she expected. 
The boldface doesn’t stop after “Thursday.” The image of the company logo doesn’t display, even though it’s saved in her images 
subfolder like all of her other images. The alternate text doesn’t display either when she hovers her mouse pointer over the
image placeholder. What adjustments could be made?

CRITERIA:
1. When hovering over the image the text "Company Logo" should pop up.
2. The words "for an emergency staff meeting" should no longer be bold.
3. The logo should appear.
4. The text "For the meeting agenda, please click the link below:" should be italic, not bold.
5. The text "Agenda Link" should be linked properly

# Lesson 10

Way to go!  You've reached the final lesson in HTML5 Web Applications.  In Lesson 10 we study the Application Development Life Cycle!

Using Chapter 1 of the Wiley HTML5 book, develop a web page with facts about HTML5 and the Application Life cycle.  You can access your copy of the book at http://computermentors.org/student.  Please ask a mentor for your login information.

Feel free to also use the study guide on our student portal as you prepare to take the certification exam.

You will receive up to 200 points for passing your exam, based upon your score.  For example, A score of 70% would receive 140 points since 140 is 70% of 200.  Or you can multiply your score percentage by 2.  80% = 160, 90% = 180, 100% = 200...

Good luck!

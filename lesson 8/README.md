# Lesson 8.1

In Lesson 8.1 we cover a brief introduction to JavaScript and important concepts.

### Instructions
1. Open Notepad, or your favorite text editor.
2. Save the file as.....

# Lesson 8.2: File API

In Lesson 8.2 we cover the JavaScript File API

### Instructions
1. Open Notepad, or your favorite text editor.  Codepen.io may also be used.
2. Save the file as fileAPI.html
3. Using the example below, reproduce the webpage with your own style


**Criteria for the Lesson 8.2 webpage:**
* Style the form generated by the code below:
* Must style #page-wrapper
* Must style h1
* Optional: Apply a background color to the #fileDisplayArea


```HTML5
<div id="page-wrapper">

		<h1>Text File Reader</h1>
		<div>
			Select a text file: 
			<input type="file" id="fileInput">
		</div>
		<pre id="fileDisplayArea"><pre>

	</div>
	 <script src="text.js"></script> <!-- ERASE THIS LINE IF YOU'RE USING CODEPEN -->
```

### File API JavaScript
1. Create a new file called fileAPI.js
2. Type the JavaScript text as seen below:

```JavaScript
window.onload = function() {
		var fileInput = document.getElementById('fileInput');
		var fileDisplayArea = document.getElementById('fileDisplayArea');

		fileInput.addEventListener('change', function(e) {
			var file = fileInput.files[0];
			var textType = /text.*/;

			if (file.type.match(textType)) {
				var reader = new FileReader();

				reader.onload = function(e) {
					fileDisplayArea.innerText = reader.result;
				}

				reader.readAsText(file);	
			} else {
				fileDisplayArea.innerText = "File not supported!"
			}
		});
}

```
## Details
Details about what the code above goes here

* `window.onload = function() {}`
    * Anything within the {} is executed after the web page is completely loaded.

* `var fileInput = document.getElementById('fileInput');`
    * Set a variable called fileInput that is linked to the input with id="fileInput"
    
 * `var fileDisplayArea = document.getElementById('fileDisplayArea');`
    * Set a variable called fileDisplayArea that is linked to the id="fileDisplayArea"
        
  * `fileInput.addEventListener('change', function(e) {}`
    * An EventListener is added to the fileInput variable
    * Whenever the user selects a file the function is executed
    
  * `var file = fileInput.files[0];`
    * This variable, named file, looks at the fileInput files property and fetches the first file
    
  * `var textType = /text.*/;`
    * Checks to see if the submitted file is a text file (*.txt)  
    
  * `if (file.type.match(textType)) {}`
    * If the submitted file is a TEXT file, code within the {} brackets is executed.
    
  * `var reader = new FileReader();`
    * If the submitted file is a TEXT file, an object containing the text is created (File Reader Instance)

  * `reader.onload = function(e) { fileDisplayArea.innerText = reader.result; }`
    * When the reader is completed (or the text file is completely added to the File Reader Instance), the RESULT is the text within the file - This text will update the "innerText" of the id="fileDisplayArea".
    
* `reader.readAsText(file);`
    * Call the readAsText() method of the File API to produce the result.
    
* `else {fileDisplayArea.innerText = "File not supported!"}`
    * If the submitted file is not a text file, display "File Not Supported!"

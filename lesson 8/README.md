# Lesson 8.2: File API

In Lesson 8.2 we cover the JavaScript File API

### Instructions
1. Open Notepad, or your favorite text editor.  Codepen.io may also be used.
2. Save the file as fileAPI.html
3. Using the example below, reproduce the webpage with your own style


**Criteria for the Lesson 8.2 webpage:**
* Style the form generated by the code below:
* Must style #page-wrapper
* Must style h1
* Optional: Apply a background color to the #fileDisplayArea


```HTML5
<div id="page-wrapper">

		<h1>Text File Reader</h1>
		<div>
			Select a text file: 
			<input type="file" id="fileInput">
		</div>
		<pre id="fileDisplayArea"><pre>

	</div>
	 <script src="text.js"></script> <!-- ERASE THIS LINE IF YOU'RE USING CODEPEN -->
```

### File API JavaScript
1. Create a new file called fileAPI.js
2. Type the JavaScript text as seen below:

```JavaScript
window.onload = function() {
		var fileInput = document.getElementById('fileInput');
		var fileDisplayArea = document.getElementById('fileDisplayArea');

		fileInput.addEventListener('change', function(e) {
			var file = fileInput.files[0];
			var textType = /text.*/;

			if (file.type.match(textType)) {
				var reader = new FileReader();

				reader.onload = function(e) {
					fileDisplayArea.innerText = reader.result;
				}

				reader.readAsText(file);	
			} else {
				fileDisplayArea.innerText = "File not supported!"
			}
		});
}

```

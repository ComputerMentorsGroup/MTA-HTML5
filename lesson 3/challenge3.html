<h2>The New Elements</h2>
<p>New HTML5 tags make Web page and application  development easier than ever. One of the very handy new features of HTML5 is the use of semantic markup.</p>

<h2>Semantic Markup</h2> 
<p><b>Semantic Markup</b> gives better meaning, or definition, to tags so they make more sense to humans, programs, and Web browsers</p>

<h2>New Tags</h2>
<p>Not all HTML tags have been replaced or updated for HTML5, but some new tags introduced in HTML5 make the work of creating Web pages a lot easier.</p>

<aside><h2>Asides</h2>
<p>An aside is a type of semantic markup that can be easily positioned on the side, like a Quick Tip or Side Note.</p></aside>

<details><summary><h2 class="more">Details?</h2></summary>
Details is a really cool feature that doesn't quite work on all browsers yet.  Basically, if people want more info, they can click on the summary to expand
for more information.  If it isn't working for you, try using Google Chrome.

Welcome to the Teen Tech web track!  We have a few tips to help you get started on your journey.

## Keep your code organized!
**Create a folder for all of your web lessons in a safe place on your laptop!**

## Get started
So how's this work? You have three options:

1. Choose a text editor!  If you're just beginning, you may start with Notepad, which comes on all Windows computers.
2. Copy/Paste the code portion of a Lesson into your text editor.
3. Complete Challenges by enrolling in the virtual classroom: https://repl.it/classroom/invite/CJuYkDU



## Getting Started with GitHub
Eventually, you may want to get your site on GitHub!  A fun way to integrate GitHub and Microsoft Visual Studio Code (a great text editor) is using the following steps.

You will need to download and install the following:
* https://code.visualstudio.com/
* https://git-scm.com/download/win

1. Create a GitHub Account (http://www.github.com)
2. Create a new repository with the following format: username.github.io
3. MAKE SURE YOU REPLACE "username" with YOUR actual username!
4. Check the box that says "Initialize with a readme"
5. Within Windows, Open Git GUI
6. Create a new repository
7. Pick a location on your computer you'd like to store these files **Let it create the folder for you!**

Configure Visual Studio Code:
1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Hold CTRL SHIFT P
3. ext install vscode-github
4. Click File - Open folder
5. Open your new folder
6. Modify the files as needed.
7. When you are finished modifying any files:
    * Save
    * Click on the Git icon (or Ctrl Shift G)
    * Type a brief summary of what you did (ex: lesson1 or challenge1) at the top of the Git panel
    * Click the Check Mark
    * Click the ... button
    * Click Push to... and choose your repository. DONE.
It sounds like a lot, but this is the best way to work on your files!

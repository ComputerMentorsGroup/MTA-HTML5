## Teen Tech Student Lessons for HTML5 
www.teen-tech.org


Welcome to the Teen Tech web track!  We have a few tips to help you get started on your journey.

## Keep your code organized!
**Create a folder for all of your web lessons in a safe place on your laptop!**

## Get started
So how's this work? You have three options:

1. Download the entire lessons package as a zip (not recommended, but easy!  You just won't have the latest stuff.)
2. Copy/Paste the pieces of code you need into your own text editor.
3. Use GitHub to fork your own versions and create a live website.
4. Complete Challenges by enrolling in the virtual classroom: https://repl.it/classroom/invite/CJuYkDU
5. Receive an invite link from a mentor to C9.io

## Getting Started with GitHub
You will need to download and install the following:
* https://code.visualstudio.com/
* https://git-for-windows.github.io/

1. Create a GitHub Account
2. Go to https://github.com/ComputerMentorsGroup/MTA-HTML5 
3. Click "FORK" at the top right
4. In settings, rename the repository to *yourusername*.**github.io**
    4. This step makes your repository a living website!  You can visit yourusername.github.io to see your site.
    4. For it to work properly, index.html will need to be in the root folder 
4. Within your new repository, copy the CLONE/DOWNLOAD web address (right side)
4. Open Git GUI
5. "Clone Existing Repository"
6. Paste the web address (from step 4) into SOURCE
7. Under target, you'll pick where you want the files to be stored on your laptop. **Let it create the folder for you!**
8. Open Visual Studio Code
9. Click File - Open folder
10. Open your new folder which should have all the lessons in it
11. Modify the files as needed.
12. When you are finished modifying any files:
    * Save
    * Click on the Git icon (or Ctrl Shift G)
    * Type a brief summary of what you did (ex: lesson1 or challenge1) at the top of the Git panel
    * Click the Check Mark
    * Click the ... button
    * Click Push to... and choose your repository. DONE.
It sounds like a lot, but this is the best way to work on your files!

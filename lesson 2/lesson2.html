<!-- Video and Audio files are inserted in a similar way.  An audio file has no
need to include the height, width, or poster (since it is not a visual element).
Audio files come in formats .mp3 and .ogg, while video formats are .mp4 and .ogv.
You can find free videos to use on videos.pexels.com - you must save them (mp4) and convert the file
to (ogv) using any free online tool.  
Why? Some browsers can only see ogv/ogg files.  The browser will pick the first compatible file to play. -->

<!-- include a message for people who have really old web browsers! -->
Sorry, Your browser does not support HTML5 videos.

<!-- classes are a GLOBAL ELEMENT used to assign elements a label for specific styling.
All we know in this example is that mainHeading is a special kind of h1, but how special?  We find out later. -->
<h1 class="mainHeading" style="color: green; font-family: Cooper Black">Company Name</h1>

<!-- FIGURE tag is any easy way to put multiple images side by side and FIGCAPTION easily lets you put a description underneathe the images. -->
<figure>
<img src="assets/company.jpg" alt="logo" style="height:200px; width:auto" />
<img src="assets/shoe.jpg" alt="Nike Shoe" style="height:200px; width:auto"  />
<img src="assets/xbox.jpg" alt="xbox controller" style="height:200px; width:auto" />
<figcaption>Product Images</figcaption>

<!-- DIV is a way to divide up the page.  Think of DIV as a room in a house - it's still part of the house, but might have
a different "theme" or appearance.  
DIVs should be named, just like the livingroom and your bedroom have names.
Sometimes DIVs will be nested, for example, a kitchen might contain the dining room all in one.
IDs will be useful when we start using JavaScript - we will cover this soon!  JavaScript makes your
web pages dynamic and interactive. 
CLASSES are used for styling.-->
<div id="welcomeMessage" class="welcome">
	<p>Welcome to <mark>the Chocolate Factory</mark>!  My name is <mark>Willy Wonka</mark>.</p>

# Lesson 5

So for lesson 5, you will be learning about flexboxes.
Flexbox refers to a layout that can be applied to a container in html, like divs, that changes the way we organzie things in them; more specifically it allows containers to spread out/distribute/align space among the items it contains. To accomplish this, the container (in accordance to how you direct it as you will learn here) alters its items' width, height and order.

Now flexboxes can get pretty confusing when its just you reading text so to help teach you how to direct flexboxes we will call upon the help of some frogs.

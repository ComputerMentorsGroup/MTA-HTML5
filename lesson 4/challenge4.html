<!-- instructions
  1. The bottom row of the table seems to have the info swapped. The Word "adorable" should be on the left cell.
  2. The list below the table should be numbered, not bulleted.
  3. The same list skips an item, remove the empty item or add something in
  4. The placeholder text in the email form should say "your email" not "placeholder"
